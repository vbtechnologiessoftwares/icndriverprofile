<li>Dispute Resolution Policy</li>
</ol>
<p>Choice of Law and Jurisdiction. All Disputes will be governed by the laws of the state of Utah, United States of America, without regard to any conflict of law principles. You agree that your access to and use of Website in any way shall be treated the same as if you were to physically visit Company’s location in Utah, and therefore, you expressly consent that the state and federal courts in Utah may exercise personal jurisdiction over you related to any Dispute.</p>
<p>Mediation. Prior to pursuing any claim as set forth in Section 11 herein, you agree to mediate any Dispute with Company. Mediation shall be conducted in good faith in Utah, and will be conducted by a non-biased, independent mediator. All parties to the mediation agree to equally split the mediator fees and associated costs. Failure to timely pay such fees or costs shall be deemed a material breach hereof and shall warrant the immediate entry of requested relief against the breaching party (i.e., default judgment, dismissal with prejudice, etc.).</p>
<p>Arbitration. IF MEDIATION IS UNSUCCESSFUL, ANY DISPUTE SHALL BE RESOLVED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION TO BE HELD IN OR NEAR SALT LAKE COUNTY, STATE OF UTAH BY A SINGLE DISINTERESTED ARBITRATOR AND PURSUANT TO UTAH LAW. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ARBITRATION DOES NOT PERMIT JUDICIAL OR CLASS ACTION PROCEEDINGS, AND YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A JUDICIAL OR CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING, EITHER AS A REPRESENTATIVE, PARTICIPANT OR MEMBER AND YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO PROCEED IN A NON-CLASS ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>Except as may be required to enforce an arbitration decision, you and the Company expressly waive the right to file any legal action in any other state or federal court or before any other tribunal, and the right to a trial by jury.</p>
<p>Attorney’s Fees. In any event any action is brought by either party arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, the parties shall be responsible for payment of their own attorney’s fees and costs.</p>
